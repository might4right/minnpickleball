        <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Line calls</em> determine whether the ball is in or out of bounds.</p>
        <p class="p">When a pickleball bounces, only a small fraction of its surface area makes contact with
            the ground. As such, line calls in pickleball must be incredibly precise.</p>
        <p class="p">Our club standard is that unless the ball is blatantly out of bounds, at least two
            players must declare the ball out, within a reasonable amount of time, for the line call
            to result in a fault.</p>
        <div class="p">
            <ul class="ul" id="topic_avz_fv5_qjb__ul_cvg_mv5_qjb">
                <li class="li">If the ball lands on a line, it's in.</li>
                <li class="li">If the ball lands in the kitchen on the serve, even if on the correct side of
                    the court, it's a fault.</li>
                <li class="li">If the ball hits the kitchen line on the serve, it's out and a service
                    fault.</li>
                <li class="li">If you are otherwise in doubt, it's in.</li>
