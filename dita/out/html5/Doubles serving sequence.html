    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">In doubles, the serving sequence ensures each player has fair opportunity to serve from
            both sides of the court.</p>
        <div class="p">
            <ol class="ol" id="topic_cgs_pjs_qjb__ol_btr_vks_qjb">
                <li class="li">Once a team gains possession of the ball, the first serve is made by the player
                    on the right. We'll call them "Server 1," and their partner "Server 2." In this
                    case, Server 1 must serve to the opposing team's right court.</li>
                <li class="li">If the receiving team faults, the serving teammates switch places. Server 1 must
                    now send the ball to the opposing team's left court.</li>
                <li class="li">Server 1 will continue to serve and switch places until their team faults.
                        <em class="ph i">"Second serve"</em> may be announced. The serving teammates do not switch
                    sides, and Server 2 must send the ball into the service court diagonal from
                    their current position.</li>
                <li class="li">Once Server 2 faults, the ball goes to the opposing team to serve. This is
                    called a <strong class="ph b">side-out.</strong> The sequence repeats from Step 1.</li>
