        <p class="p">A typical pickleball game is played to 11 points and won by two points. </p>
        <p class="p">Overtime starts when the score reaches 10-10. The rules for overtime play are the same as
            the rules for normal play.</p>
        <p class="p">Important to pickleball is that <strong class="ph b"><em class="ph i">only the currently serving team can score
                    points.</em></strong> While this rule can make games a little longer, it also makes
            for some riveting comebacks and upsets.</p>
        <p class="p">Scores are announced before each serve. The server/serving team's score is announced
            first, then the receiver/receiving team's. </p>
        <p class="p">In doubles, a third number, either 1 or 2, indicates which teammate is serving. Refer to
                <a class="xref" href="Doubles%20serving%20sequence.html">"The doubles serving sequence"</a>
            for more information.</p>
        <p class="p">To comply with the doubles serving sequence, the very first serve of a doubles game is
            always scored <em class="ph i">0-0-2.</em> "2," in this case, is the player standing behind the right
            service court.</p>
