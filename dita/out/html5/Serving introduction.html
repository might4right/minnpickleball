    <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">These serving guidelines apply to any form of pickleball.</p>
        <p class="p">All serves must be underhand, and from behind the baseline with at least one foot.</p>
        <p class="p">Serves must be cross-court diagonally, landing within the service court at the
            cater-corner to the server's own. The baselines, sidelines, and center line are
            considered in. The kitchen line is considered out.</p>
        <p class="p">You have only one attempt per rally to make a successful serve, unless there is a
                <strong class="ph b">let</strong>. A let is when the ball touches the net on the serve and still lands in
            the correct service court. In this case, the server must try again.</p>
        <p class="p">If, on a serve, the ball hits the top of the net then lands on the kitchen line on the
            other side, it is out of bounds and not considered a let.</p>
