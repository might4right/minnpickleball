        <p class="p">Pickleball, like tennis, is all about using your paddle to keep the ball moving back and
            forth in a controlled sequence. </p>
        <p class="p">The ball can only bounce once on each side of the court before being <em class="ph i">returned</em>, or
            sent to your opponent's side. Under certain circumstances, you can also return the ball
            without it bouncing. This is called a <em class="ph i">volley</em>.</p>
        <p class="p">When a player breaks the sequence, it is a <em class="ph i">fault</em>. Common faults include hitting
            the ball into the net, letting it bounce twice in a row, or sending it out of
            bounds.</p>
