    <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">For its simplicity, pickleball has quite a few rules regarding when you can
        volley.</p>
        <p class="p">The kitchen is sometimes called the <em class="ph i">non-volley zone</em>. It is the space within 7 feet
            on both sides of the net. You cannot volley while standing in the kitchen for any
            reason; this is a surprisingly common fault.</p>
        <p class="p">USAPA keeps an exhaustive list of what constitutes a kitchen fault, but it can be boiled
            down to five basic principles.</p>
        <div class="p">
            <ol class="ol" id="topic_t4f_nns_qjb__ol_jd4_qns_qjb">
                <li class="li">If, when volleying, you have even one foot in the kitchen and/or on the kitchen
                    line, it's a fault.</li>
                <li class="li">If momentum carries you or anything you are wearing or carrying into the kitchen
                    while volleying, it's a fault.</li>
                <li class="li">If, right after volleying, you touch the kitchen, it's a fault. Even if the ball
                    is declared dead before you touch the kitchen, it is still a fault.</li>
                <li class="li">You can stand in the kitchen at any time, <em class="ph i">so long as you're not
                        volleying.</em></li>
                <li class="li">The kitchen is a two-dimensional rectangle, not a three-dimensional box. You can
                    volley if the ball is over the kitchen, so long as your feet are not in the
                    kitchen.</li>
