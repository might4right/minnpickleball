<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >Pickleball is a cross between tennis, badminton, and ping-pong. It is played with a
thick plastic ball, wood or plastic paddles, and a low net.
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1000"></a>Mechanics</h3>
<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >Like most racquet sports, pickleball is all about using your paddle to keep the ball
moving back and forth in a controlled sequence. The ball can only bounce once on
each side of the court. Under certain circumstances, you can also <span 
class="ecti-1000">volley, </span>hitting the
ball before it bounces on your side of the court.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   When a player breaks the sequence, such as by hitting the ball into the net,
letting it bounce twice in a row, or sending it out of bounds, he/she has committed a
<span 
class="ecti-1000">fault </span>(also called an <span 
class="ecti-1000">error.</span>) The time from when the ball is <span 
class="ecti-1000">served </span>(set in motion)
to the time a fault is committed is called a <span 
class="ecti-1000">rally. </span>If you fault, either the
other team will gain points or you/your team will lose the opportunity to
serve.
<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Serving</h3>
<!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >All serves must be underhand, and from behind the baseline with at least one
foot.
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   Serves must be cross-court diagonally and land within the appropriate <span 
class="ecti-1000">service box</span>.
The baseline, sidelines, and center line are considered <span 
class="ecti-1000">in</span>. The kitchen line is
considered <span 
class="ecti-1000">out</span>.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   You only have one attempt per rally to make a successful serve, unless there is a
<span 
class="ecti-1000">let</span>. A let is when the ball touches the net on the serve and still lands in the correct
service box. In this case, the server must try again.
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>The singles serving sequence</h4>
<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >In singles, the serving player will serve from the right court when their score is even,
and from the left court when their score is odd.
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>The doubles serving sequence</h4>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >The serving sequence ensures each player on a doubles court has a fair opportunity to
serve from both halves of the court.
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Once a team gains possession of the ball, the first serve is made by the
     player on the right. This is Server 1. They must serve to the opposing

     team&#8217;s right court.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">If the receiving team faults, the serving teammates switch sides of the
     court. Server 1 must now send the ball to the opposing team&#8217;s left court.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Server 1 will continue to serve until he/she commits a fault. In this case,
     their teammate, Server 2, gets the ball. <span 
class="ecti-1000">&#8220;Second serve&#8221; </span>may be announced<span 
class="ecti-1000">.</span>
     The serving teammates do not switch sides, and Server 2 must send the
     ball into the service box diagonal from their current position on the court.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Once Server 2 faults, the ball goes to the opposing team to serve. <span 
class="ecti-1000">&#8220;Side</span>
     <span 
class="ecti-1000">out&#8221; </span>may be announced. The sequence repeats.</li></ul>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>At the start of a doubles game</h4>
<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >At the beginning of a doubles game, only the right player on the serving team has the
opportunity to serve. The starting score is always &#8220;0-0-2.&#8221; Variations such as
&#8220;0-0-start&#8221; mean the same thing, but these announcements are not approved for
official USAPA play to simplify things for the referees.
<!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >   Once the right player faults, this is a side-out and the serve goes to the right
player on the opposing team.
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>The second-bounce rule</h3>
<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >When the ball is served, the receiving team must let it bounce in their court before
returning the serve. After the return, the serving team must then let the bounce in
their court. Only after the ball has bounced once in each court is it legal to
volley.
<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>The kitchen</h3>
<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >The kitchen is sometimes called the <span 
class="ecti-1000">non-volley zone. </span>It is the space within 7 feet on
both sides of the net. You cannot volley within the kitchen for any reason; this is a
fault.
<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   USAPA has an exhaustive list of what constitutes a kitchen fault, but it can be
boiled down to five principles:

     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7002x1">If, when volleying, you have even one foot in the kitchen and/or on the
     kitchen line, it&#8217;s a fault.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7004x2">If momentum carries you or anything you are wearing/carrying into the
     kitchen while volleying, it&#8217;s a fault.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7006x3">If, right after volleying, you touch the kitchen, it&#8217;s a fault, even if the ball
     is declared dead before you touch the kitchen.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7008x4">You can stand in the kitchen at any time, so long as you&#8217;re not volleying.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7010x5">The kitchen is a two-dimensional rectangle, not a three-dimensional box.
     You can volley if the ball is <span 
class="ecti-1000">over </span>the kitchen, so long as your feet are not
     in the kitchen.</li></ol>
<!--l. 108--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>Line calls</h3>
<!--l. 110--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ecti-1000">Line calls </span>are determinations regarding whether the ball is in or out of bounds.
<!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   When a pickleball bounces, only a small fraction of its surface area makes contact
with the ground. As such, line calls in pickleball must be incredibly precise. If in
doubt, the ball is in.
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">If the ball lands on a line, it&#8217;s in.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">If the ball hits the kitchen line on a serve, it&#8217;s out and a service fault.</li></ul>
<!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" >There are a few important rules of etiquette surrounding line calls:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">It&#8217;s the responsibility of each team to make line calls on their respective
     sides of the court&#8211;not the other team, and not spectators.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">If a line call is questionable, give your opponent the benefit of the doubt.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Line  calls  must  be  made  immediately  once  the  ball  hits  the  court.
     Otherwise, the ball will be considered in.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">For clarity, make your line call by voice and hand gesture.</li></ul>

<!--l. 132--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>Scoring</h3>
<!--l. 134--><p class="noindent" >A typical pickleball game is played to 11 points and won by two points. A score of
10-10, for example, indicates the beginning of overtime; in this case, 12 is the winning
score.
<!--l. 138--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="ecbx-1000">Only the serving team can score points. </span>Scores are announced before each
serve; the serving team&#8217;s score first, followed by the receiving team. In doubles, a
third number is included in the score (see below.)
<!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-10000"></a>The third number</h4>
<!--l. 145--><p class="noindent" >In doubles, the <span 
class="ecti-1000">third number </span>identifies which teammate is serving, and can
be either 1 or 2. Refer to &#8220;The doubles serving sequence&#8221; above for more
information.
<!--l. 149--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-11000"></a>Starting a doubles game</h4>
<!--l. 151--><p class="noindent" >To comply with the doubles serving sequence, the very first serve of a doubles game
is always scored &#8220;0-0-2.&#8221; &#8220;2&#8221; in this case is the player in the right service box.
