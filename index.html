    <p align=center>Pickleball is a combination of tennis and badminton; a new yet familiar game requiring finesse and quick reaction time. It'll take you a few hours to learn, but a few years to master.</p>

<h2>Meetings</h2>

<h3>Time and location</h3>

    <p><b>When:</b> The Club holds regular meetings <i>every Friday</i>, from <i>4 - 6 pm.</i></p>
    
    <p><b>Where:</b> Our typical meeting location is the Rec's North Gym.</p> 
    
    <p>After entering the Rec, take the stairs to the second floor, then turn left. Follow the corridor past the ellipticals and proceed through the skyway to the North Building. Go up one more flight of stairs and the gym will be on the right. </p> 
    
    <p>Alternatively, if you make use of the Rec's locker room facilities, exit on the North Area side (away from the showers) and take the stairs/elevator to floor 3. The gym will be on the right.</p>
    
    <b>How much?</b> All club activities are absolutely FREE so long as you are a RecWell member. This includes SSF-paying students and those with faculty and staff memberships.

<h3>What to expect</h3>
    
    <p>Our meetings primarily consist of informal social matches. Where most clubs focus on doubles, we focus on both doubles and singles equally, giving you a chance to excel both on your own and as part of a team. Our three courts allow you to squeeze in as much play time as you desire.</p>

    <p>Depending on attendance and skill level, we may practice with some drills or play rapid-fire games. King of the Court is a club staple, but we may also play short rally-score games or rotating-court matches.</p>
    
    <p>A frequently-asked question is <i>"do I need my own paddle or balls?"</i> While you're welcome to use your own paddle, you don't have to bring anything. We provide high-quality composite paddles and indoor balls at no extra charge. If you decide to purchase a paddle, we are happy to recommend a model which will make your natural playing style shine through!</p>
