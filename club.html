	<h2>Meeting times and locations</h2>
<br>
    <p><b>When:</b> The club holds regular meetings <i>every Friday</i> during the regular academic year, from <i>4 - 6 pm.</i></p><br>
    
	<p><b>Where:</b> Our typical meeting location is the <i>North Gym of the Rec Center.</i> After entering the Rec, take the stairs to the second floor, then turn left. Follow the corridor past the ellipticals and proceed through the skyway to the North Building. Go up one more flight of stairs and the gym will be on the right. Alternatively, if you make use of the Rec's locker room facilities, exit on the North Area side (away from the showers) and take the stairs/elevator to floor 3. The gym will be on the right. We normally play in the back section, opposite of the doors; just follow the sound of the paddles.</p><br>
    
	<p><b>How much?</b> <i>All club activities are absolutely FREE so long as you are a RecWell member.</i> This includes SSF-paying students and those with faculty and staff memberships.</p><br>

<h2>What to expect</h2><br>
    <p>On an average meeting day, attendance is consistent. Usually we have about twelve players, but our current record is 32!</p><br>
	
	<p>MPC is not a competitive club; instead, we focus on education and social matches. Our experience has shown learning by doing to be the best way to orient new players to the game. Members are always happy to teach and offer tips from their own experience. By eliminating pressure to perform and fostering a learning environment, our goal is to keep your mind clear, respect your learning pace, and allow you to focus on playing at your best.</p><br>
	
	<p>Where most clubs focus on doubles, we focus on both doubles and singles equally, giving you a chance to excel both on your own and as part of a team. Our three courts allow you to squeeze in as much play time as you desire.</p><br>

    <p>Depending on attendance and skill level, we may lead drills or play rapid-fire games. King of the Court, whether singles or doubles, is a club staple.</p><br>
    
	<p><b><i>While you're welcome to use your own paddle, you don't have to bring anything.</i></b> Thanks to a generous professional instructor and officer, we provide high-quality composite paddles and indoor balls at no extra charge. If you decide to purchase a paddle, we are happy to recommend a model which will make your natural playing style shine through!</p><br><br>
