\begin_body

\begin_layout Standard
Pickleball is a cross between tennis, badminton, and ping-pong.
 It is played with a thick plastic ball, wood or plastic paddles, and a
 low net.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Mechanics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like most racquet sports, pickleball is all about using your paddle to keep
 the ball moving back and forth in a controlled sequence.
 The ball can only bounce once on each side of the court.
 Under certain circumstances, you can also 
\emph on
volley, 
\emph default
hitting the ball before it bounces on your side of the court.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a player breaks the sequence, such as by hitting the ball into the
 net, letting it bounce twice in a row, or sending it out of bounds, he/she
 has committed a 
\emph on
fault 
\emph default
(also called an 
\emph on
error.
\emph default
) The time from when the ball is 
\emph on
served
\emph default
 (set in motion) to the time a fault is committed is called a 
\emph on
rally.

\emph default
 If you fault, either the other team will gain points or you/your team will
 lose the opportunity to serve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Serving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All serves must be underhand, and from behind the baseline with at least
 one foot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serves must be cross-court diagonally and land within the appropriate 
\emph on
service box
\emph default
.
 The baseline, sidelines, and center line are considered 
\emph on
in
\emph default
.
 The kitchen line is considered 
\emph on
out
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You only have one attempt per rally to make a successful serve, unless there
 is a 
\emph on
let
\emph default
.
 A let is when the ball touches the net on the serve and still lands in
 the correct service box.
 In this case, the server must try again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
The singles serving sequence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In singles, the serving player will serve from the right court when their
 score is even, and from the left court when their score is odd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
The doubles serving sequence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The serving sequence ensures each player on a doubles court has a fair opportuni
ty to serve from both halves of the court.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Once a team gains possession of the ball, the first serve is made by the
 player on the right.
 This is Server 1.
 They must serve to the opposing team's right court.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the receiving team faults, the serving teammates switch sides of the
 court.
 Server 1 must now send the ball to the opposing team's left court.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Server 1 will continue to serve until he/she commits a fault.

\emph on
 
\emph default
In this case, their teammate, Server 2, gets the ball.
 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Second serve
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\emph default
may be announced
\emph on
.

\emph default
 The serving teammates do not switch sides, and Server 2 must send the ball
 into the service box diagonal from their current position on the court.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Once Server 2 faults, the ball goes to the opposing team to serve.
 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Side out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\emph default
may be announced.
 The sequence repeats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
At the start of a doubles game
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the beginning of a doubles game, only the right player on the serving
 team has the opportunity to serve.
 The starting score is always 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

0-0-2.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Variations such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

0-0-start
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 mean the same thing, but these announcements are not approved for official
 USAPA play to simplify things for the referees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the right player faults, this is a side-out and the serve goes to the
 right player on the opposing team.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
The second-bounce rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the ball is served, the receiving team must let it bounce in their
 court before returning the serve.
 After the return, the serving team must then let the bounce in their court.
 Only after the ball has bounced once in each court is it legal to volley.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
The kitchen
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The kitchen is sometimes called the 
\emph on
non-volley zone.

\emph default
 It is the space within 7 feet on both sides of the net.
 You cannot volley within the kitchen for any reason; this is a fault.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
USAPA has an exhaustive list of what constitutes a kitchen fault, but it
 can be boiled down to five principles:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If, when volleying, you have even one foot in the kitchen and/or on the
 kitchen line, it's a fault.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If momentum carries you or anything you are wearing/carrying into the kitchen
 while volleying, it's a fault.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If, right after volleying, you touch the kitchen, it's a fault, even if
 the ball is declared dead before you touch the kitchen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You can stand in the kitchen at any time, so long as you're not volleying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The kitchen is a two-dimensional rectangle, not a three-dimensional box.
 You can volley if the ball is 
\emph on
over
\emph default
 the kitchen, so long as your feet are not in the kitchen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Line calls
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Line calls 
\emph default
are determinations regarding whether the ball is in or out of bounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a pickleball bounces, only a small fraction of its surface area makes
 contact with the ground.
 As such, line calls in pickleball must be incredibly precise.
 If in doubt, the ball is in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the ball lands on a line, it's in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the ball hits the kitchen line on a serve, it's out and a service fault.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few important rules of etiquette surrounding line calls:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It's the responsibility of each team to make line calls on their respective
 sides of the courtâ€“not the other team, and not spectators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If a line call is questionable, give your opponent the benefit of the doubt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Line calls must be made immediately once the ball hits the court.
 Otherwise, the ball will be considered in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For clarity, make your line call by voice and hand gesture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Scoring
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical pickleball game is played to 11 points and won by two points.
 A score of 10-10, for example, indicates the beginning of overtime; in
 this case, 12 is the winning score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Only the serving team can score points.
 
\series default
Scores are announced before each serve; the serving team's score first,
 followed by the receiving team.
 In doubles, a third number is included in the score (see below.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
The third number
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In doubles, the 
\emph on
third number
\emph default
 identifies which teammate is serving, and can be either 1 or 2.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Starting a doubles game
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To comply with the doubles serving sequence, the very first serve of a doubles
 game is always scored
