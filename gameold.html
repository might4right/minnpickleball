	<h2>Mechanics</h2><br>
	<p>Like most racquet sports, pickleball is all about using your paddle to keep the ball moving back and forth in a controlled sequence.</p><br>

    <p>The ball can only bounce once on each side of the court before being <b>returned</b>, or sent to your opponent's side. Under certain circumstances, you can also return the ball before it bounces on your side of the court. This is called a <b>volley.</b><br><br>

	<p>When a player breaks the sequence, such as by hitting the ball into the net, letting it bounce twice in a row, or sending it out of bounds, they have committed a <b>fault</b> (sometimes called an <b>error</b>.)</p><br>

	<p>The time from when the ball is <i>served</i> (set in motion) to the time a fault is committed is called a <i>rally</i>. If you fault, either the other team will gain points or you/your team will lose the opportunity to serve.</p><br>

<br><br>

	<h2>Serving</h2><br>

	<p>Regardless of the kind of pickleball you are playing, there are a few standard serving rules.</p><br>

	<p>All serves must be underhand, and from behind the <b>baseline</b> with at least one foot. (The baseline is the line that marks the very back of the court.)</p><br>

	<p>Serves must be <i>cross-court diagonal</i>. This means that they must land within the service court at the cater-corner of your own.</p><br>

	<p>The baseline, sidelines, and center line are considered in. The kitchen line is considered out.</p><br>

	<p>You only have one attempt to make a successful serve, unless there is a <b>let</b>. A let is when the ball touches the net on the serve and still lands in the correct service court. If you let, you must try again.</p><br>

	<h3>A beginning serving technique</h3>

	There are many different methods of serving, but this is the best one for beginners. If you are left-handed, modify sides as necessary.

	<ol>
		<li>Determine your place in the serving sequence, then announce the current score of the game. (The serving sequence and scoring depends on the type of pickleball you are playing. Both will be discussed later.)</li>
		<li>Point your entire body in the direction you need to serve. Step slightly forward with your left foot. This will set you up for a driving "pivot" motion that will add depth to your serve.</li>
		<li>With your left hand, hold the ball in front of your paddle. Hold the paddle in your right hand so the handle is pointing toward your upper body. Usually, this is at a ten o'clock position.</li>
		<li>Let go of the ball with your left hand. At the same time, pivot with your right foot and drive the paddle forward, keeping your wrist straight.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3>The singles serving sequence</h3><br>
	<p>In singles, the serving player will serve from the right court when their score is even, and from the left court when their score is odd. If the serving player faults, the ball goes to their opponent.</p><br>

	<h3>The doubles serving sequence</h3><br>
	<p>The serving sequence ensures each player on a doubles court has a fair opportunity to serve from both service courts. It also explains quite a bit about how doubles is scored.</p><br>

	<il id="ruleslist">
	<li>Once a team gains possession of the ball, the first serve is made by the player on the right. This is Server 1. They must serve to the opposing team's right court.</li>
	<li>If the receiving team faults, the serving teammates switch places. Server 1 must now send the ball to the opposing team's left court.</li>
	<li>Server 1 will continue to serve and switch sides until they or their teammate fault. In this case, their teammate gets the ball. <i>"Second serve"</i> may be announced. The serving teammates do not switch sides, and Server 2 must send the ball into the service court diagonal from their current position on the court.</li>
	<li>Once Server 2 faults, the ball goes to the opposing team to serve. This is called a <i>"side-out"</i>. The sequence repeats.</li></il><br>

	<h3>At the start of a doubles game</h3><br>
	<p>At the beginning of a doubles game, only the right player on the serving team has the opportunity to serve. The starting score is always <i>0-0-2.</i> Some clubs use the unofficial <i>"0-0-start"</i> to denote the unique serving sequence.</p><br>
	<p>Once the right player faults during this first set of rallies, this is a side-out and the serve goes to the right player on the opposing team.</p><br>

<br><br>

	<h2>The two-bounce rule</h2><br>
	<p>When the ball is served, the receiving team must let it bounce in their court before returning the serve. After the return, the serving team must then let the ball bounce in their court. Only after the ball has bounced once in each court is it legal to volley. Otherwise, it's a fault.</p><br>

	<h2>The kitchen</h2><br>
	<p>The kitchen is sometimes called the <i>non-volley zone.</i> It is the space within 7 feet on both sides of the net. You cannot volley while standing in the kitchen for any reason; this is a surprisingly common fault.</p><br>
	<p>USAPA keeps an exhaustive list of what constitutes a kitchen fault, but it can be boiled down to five basic principles.</p><br>

	<il id="ruleslist">
	<li>If, when volleying, you have even one foot in the kitchen and/or on the kitchen line, it's a fault.</li>
	<li>If momentum carries you or anything you are wearing or carrying into the kitchen while volleying, it's a fault.</li>
	<li>If, right after volleying, you touch the kitchen, it's a fault. Even if the ball is declared dead before you touch the kitchen, it is still a fault.</li>
	<li>You can stand in the kitchen at any time, <i>so long as you're not volleying</i>.</li>
	<li>The kitchen is a two-dimensional rectangle, not a three-dimensional box. You can volley if the ball is <i>over</i> the kitchen, so long as your feet are not in the kitchen.</li>
	</il><br>

	<h2>Line calls</h2><br>
	<p><i>Line calls</i> are determinations regarding whether the ball is in bounds.</p><br>
	<p>When a pickleball bounces, only a small fraction of its surface area makes contact with the ground. As such, line calls in pickleball must be incredibly precise. If the ball lands on a line or you are otherwise in doubt, it's in.</p><br> <p>The only exception is if the ball hits the kitchen line on the serve. (That's a service fault.)</p><br>

	<h2>Scoring</h2><br>
	<p>A typical pickleball game is played to 11 points and won by two points. Overtime starts when the score reaches 10-10. It is played by the same rules as normal.</p><br>
	<p>Important to pickleball is that <b><i>only the serving team can score points.</i></b> While this rule can make games a little longer, it also makes for some riveting comebacks and upsets.</p><br>
	<p>Scores are announced before each serve. The server's score is announced first, then the receiver's. In doubles, a third number is included in the score representing which teammate is serving; it can be 1 or 2. Refer to "The doubles serving sequence" above for more information.</p><br>
	<p>To comply with the doubles serving sequence, the very first serve of a doubles game is always scored <i>0-0-2</i>. "2" in this case is the player in the right service court.</p><br>
