            <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Line calls</em> are determinations regarding whether the ball is in bounds. A few
                hard and fast rules can help determine if the ball is in or out of bounds.</p>

                <span class="ph cmd"><strong class="ph b">Keep your eye on the ball.</strong> When a pickleball bounces, only a small
                    fraction of its surface area makes contact with the ground. As such, line
                    calling requires a great degree of precision.</span>
            </li><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd"><strong class="ph b">Consider the stage of the rally.</strong> If the ball hits the kitchen line on
                    the serve, it is a service fault, even if the ball contacts the net before going
                    over.</span>
            </li><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd"><strong class="ph b">Consider the lines of the court.</strong> If the ball lands on an outside line,
                    it is always considered in.</span>
            </li><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd"><strong class="ph b">Consult other players, including the opposing team.</strong> A good standard is
                    that at least two players must have seen where the ball landed within a
                    reasonable amount of time for it to be considered out.</span>
            </li><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd"><strong class="ph b">What the opponent says usually goes.</strong> Out of fairness, if both teammates
                    on the calling side are in doubt, the ball is considered in.</span>
            </li><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd"><strong class="ph b">If everyone is in doubt, either redo the rally or call the ball in.</strong> Both
                    of these options are ideal. The important thing is that you offer ample courtesy
                    and the benefit of the doubt to your opponents.</span>
