    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The singles serving sequence is very much like other racquet sports.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">In singles, once you receive the ball, your first serve will always be from the right
                court.</strong></p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">If you score a point, </strong>both you and your opponent will switch to the other service
            court, and you will be serving along the opposite diagonal.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">If you fault,</strong> your opponent gets to serve from their own right service court. When
            this happens, it is called a <em class="ph i">side-out.</em></p>
        <p class="p">The general rule of thumb for singles is that you will serve from the right court when
            your score is even, and from the left court when your score is odd.</p>
