    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The traditional mode of pickleball scoring is designed to fit with the flow of the
        game.</p>
        <p class="p">A typical pickleball game is played to 11 points and won by two points. Overtime starts
            when the score reaches 10-10. It is played by the same rules as normal time.</p>
        <p class="p">Important to pickleball is that <strong class="ph b">only the serving team can score points.</strong></p>
        <p class="p">Scores are announced before each serve as follows.</p>
        <div class="p">
            <ul class="ul" id="standard_scoring__ul_k1z_zjm_sjb">
                <li class="li">First, announce the server/serving team's score.</li>
                <li class="li">Next, announce the receiver/receiving team's score.</li>
                <li class="li">If you are playing doubles, a third number is included representing which
                    teammate is serving. It can be 1 or 2. Refer to <a class="xref" href="Doubles%20serving%20sequence.html">Doubles%20serving%20sequence.html</a> for more information.</li>
                <li class="li">Remember that the very first serve of a doubles game is always scored 0-0-2. "2"
                    in this case represents the player in the right service court.</li>
