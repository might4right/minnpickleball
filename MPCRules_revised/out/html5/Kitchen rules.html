        sport.</p>
        <p class="p">The <em class="ph i">kitchen</em> is sometimes called the <em class="ph i">non-volley zone.</em> It is the space within
            7 feet on both sides of the net.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">You cannot volley while standing in the kitchen for any reason.</strong></p>
        <p class="p">USAPA, the governing body of American pickleball, keeps an exhaustive list of what does
            and does not constitute a kitchen fault. For sake of simplicity, we boil them down to
            five rules.</p>

                    dead beforehand.</li>
