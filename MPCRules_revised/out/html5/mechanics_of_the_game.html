    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Like most racquet sports, pickleball is all about using your paddle to keep the ball
        moving back and forth in a controlled sequence.</p>
        <p class="p">The ball can only bounce once on each side of the court before being <em class="ph i">returned</em>, or
            sent to your opponent's side. Under certain circumstances, you can also return the ball
            before it bounces on your side of the court. This is called a <em class="ph i">volley</em>.</p>
        <p class="p">When a player breaks the sequence, such as by hitting the ball into the net, letting it
            bounce twice in a row, or sending it out of bounds, they have committed a <em class="ph i">fault</em>
            (sometimes called an <em class="ph i">error</em>.)</p>
        <p class="p">The time from when the ball is <em class="ph i">served</em> (set in motion) to the time a fault is
            committed is called a <em class="ph i">rally</em>. If you fault, either the other team will gain points
            or you/your team will lose the opportunity to serve.</p>
