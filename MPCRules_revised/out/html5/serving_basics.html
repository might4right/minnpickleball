    <div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">Regardless of the kind of pickleball you are playing, there are a few standard
        serving rules.</p>
        <section class="section context">
            <p class="p">All serves must be underhand, and from behind your side's baseline with at least one
                foot. The baseline marks the very back of the court.</p>
            <p class="p">Serves must be cross-court diagonally. This means that they must land within the
                service court at the cater-corner of your own.</p>
            <p class="p">The baseline, sidelines, and center line are considered in. The kitchen line is
                considered out.</p>
            <p class="p">You only have one attempt per rally to make a successful serve, unless there is a
                    <strong class="ph b">let</strong>. A let is when the ball touches the net on the serve and still lands
                in the correct service court. If you let, you must try again.</p>
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">There are many different methods of serving, but this is the best one for
                    beginners.</strong></p>
        </section>
        <section><ol class="ol steps"><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">Determine your place in the serving sequence, then announce the current score
                    of the game. See "The singles serving sequence," "The doubles serving sequence,"
                    and "Scoring basics" for more details.</span>
            </li><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">Point your entire body in the direction you need to serve. Step slightly
                    forward with your left foot. This will set you up for a driving "pivot" motion
                    that will add depth to your serve.</span>
            </li><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">With your left hand, hold the ball in front of your paddle. Hold the paddle so
                    the handle is pointing toward your upper body (usually this is a 10:00
                    position.)</span>
            </li><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">Let go of the ball with your left hand. At the same time, pivot with your right
                    foot and drive the paddle forward, keeping your wrist straight.</span>
